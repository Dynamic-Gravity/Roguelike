# Roguelike
A rogue-like CLI game written in C++.

## Important!
The game grid is based on a fixed console size of 80 x 24. At this time this is the only support column size (until I can figure out how to dynamically make mazes). Please set your terminal to this size so the game will behave normally.

### Installation
```shell
make
```
### Execution
```shell
make run
#or
./Game.out
```
